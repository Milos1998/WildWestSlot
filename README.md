Note: game has cheat mode, where you can remove or add symbols. It is activated by clicking and holding information button in the upper right corner for 1 second.

# Project setup
`npm install`

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development
`npm run dev`

## Compiles and minifies for production
`npm run build-only`

This command compiles dist file. After building you have to serve your dist file. For Ubuntu you can run `serve -s dist` to serve it locally.

## Formats src files
`npm run prettier-format`

# What I learned
During this project I've learned:
- Typescript
- Webpack advanced features (adding plugins, using linter within webpack etc.)
- pixijs advanced features (using loader, masking, animating with gsap, etc.)
- how to use prettier (as suggestion from mentor)
- how to use linter (as suggestion from mentor)
- singleton creation pattern (as suggestion from mentor)
- memory profiling chrome devtool - basics (used for detecting memory leaks)
- I've learned that garbage collector doesn't affect GPU's memory and that it has to be emptied by programmer
- Autoplay policy in Chrome and other browsers and that it can't be defeated
- gsap has great support service
